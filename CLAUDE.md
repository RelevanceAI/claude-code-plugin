# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with the Relevance AI plugin.

## Project Overview

This is a Claude Code plugin that provides integration with the Relevance AI platform via a remote MCP server. It exposes tools for managing tools (studios), agents, triggers, workforces (multi-agent systems), marketplace listings, conversations, and OAuth accounts via the Relevance AI API.

## Claude Code Workflow

**This section defines how Claude Code should behave when using this plugin.** Non-technical users work here, so Claude Code handles operations automatically.

### Proactive Testing: Define Test Rubric Before Building

When creating a new **agent, tool, or workforce**, proactively create a testing rubric BEFORE building:

1. **Design Phase** - Create a testing rubric with 3-5 qualitative checks
2. **Present to User** - Ask: "Before I build this, here's my testing plan. Does this cover what you need?"
3. **Get Approval** - Wait for user confirmation or adjustments
4. **Build** - Create the agent/tool/workforce
5. **Execute Tests** - Run through the testing rubric
6. **Report Results** - Show pass/fail for each check

Testing rubric templates and examples are in each skill: `managing-relevance-agents/creating.md`, `managing-relevance-tools/creating.md`, `managing-relevance-workforces/SKILL.md`.

## Critical: Always Check Skills Before Working

**Before working on agents, tools, workforces, or knowledge tables, ALWAYS read the relevant skill files first.** This CLAUDE.md is a slim summary — the skills contain the detailed patterns, code examples, and gotchas you need to avoid errors.

- Building/editing an agent? → Read `managing-relevance-agents/` files first
- Building/editing a tool? → Read `managing-relevance-tools/` files first
- Building a workforce? → Read `managing-relevance-workforces/` files first
- Working with knowledge tables? → Read `managing-relevance-knowledge/` files first

## Critical API Patterns

Most common gotchas at a glance. Full details and examples are in the skill files above.

### Publish Behavior

| Operation | Auto-publishes? | Notes |
|-----------|-----------------|-------|
| `relevance_upsert_tool` | Yes | `relevance_publish_tool` returns friendly "already published" if called after |
| `relevance_save_agent_draft` | Yes (default) | Pass `autoPublish: false` to save draft only |
| `relevance_create_workforce` | Configurable | Use `shouldPublish: true` (default) |

### No Partial Updates for Agents

Tools auto-merge on update. **Agents do NOT** — always fetch first, merge, then save:

```typescript
const {agent} = await relevance_get_agent({ agentId: "x" });
agent.name = "new";
await relevance_save_agent_draft({ agentId: "x", agentConfig: agent });
```

### `state_mapping` is REQUIRED for Tools

Every tool MUST have a `state_mapping` field. Without it, `{{search_query}}` won't resolve. Do NOT use curly braces in state_mapping values — use `"params.name"` not `"{{params.name}}"`. See `managing-relevance-tools/creating.md` for examples.

### Agent Actions Require project/region

Every action must include `project` and `region` fields. The `region` must match **where the tool exists**, not your API region. See `managing-relevance-agents/actions.md` for finding correct regions.

### Workforces, Not Sub-Agents

Adding sub-agents to an agent's `actions` array is **DEPRECATED**. Use workforces instead. See `managing-relevance-workforces/`.

### Phantom Tools: Never Persist in Actions

Phantom tools are system-injected at runtime from agent settings. Never add them to `actions` manually. Enable via settings (e.g., `thinking_tool: { enabled: true }`). The MCP's `saveDraft` strips them automatically. See `managing-relevance-agents/phantom-tools.md`.

### Attaching Tools to Agents

Use `relevance_attach_tools_to_agent` — it handles fetch, merge, save, publish, action ID retrieval, and system prompt injection in one call. Test each tool with `relevance_trigger_tool` first — tools that return empty `{}` need their output config fixed.

### Reserved Variable Prefixes

| Prefix | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `secrets.*` | Project-level encrypted secrets |
| `snippets.*` | Project content templates |
| `_knowledge.*` | Knowledge set content |
| `_workforce_node.*` | Workforce system |
| `_mcp.*` | MCP integration |
| `_actions.*` | Agent action references |

### Template Resolution Priority

Resolution order: `secrets.*` → `snippets.*` → `_knowledge.*` → reserved prefixes → state object (`params.*`, `steps.*`, `node_context.*`)

## Environment Variables & Project Configuration

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `RELEVANCE_PROJECT` | Yes | Project ID |
| `RELEVANCE_API_KEY` | Yes | API key (starts with `sk-`) |
| `RELEVANCE_REGION` | Yes | Region code (e.g., `f1db6c`, `bcbe5a`) |

For backward compatibility, `US_RELEVANCE_*` variants are also supported.

## Handling Large MCP Tool Outputs

Tools like `relevance_get_task_view` and `relevance_trigger_agent_sync` can return 100KB-500KB+ JSON responses.

```bash
# CORRECT - limit input size FIRST
timeout 3s head -c 50000 /path/to/file.json | jq ...

# CORRECT - use timeout prefix
timeout 5s jq '.results[0]' /path/to/file.json
```

Don't grep large JSON files. Use `head -c` before piping. Set timeouts on bash commands.
